### README for End-to-End Vehicle Insurance Fraud Prediction

#### Overview
This notebook presents an end-to-end solution for predicting vehicle insurance fraud. It addresses the challenge of class imbalance by employing resampling techniques and builds predictive models using ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

#### Problem Statement
The goal of this notebook is to predict fraudulent vehicle insurance claims, an issue that can lead to significant financial loss for insurance providers.

#### Data Exploration
The notebook begins with an exploratory analysis of the data, including an examination of the distribution of classes and basic statistics.

#### Modeling Approach
The notebook employs ensemble learning methods, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to create predictive models. Various model evaluation techniques like ROC curve, AUC score, and confusion matrix are also used to assess model performance.

#### Results and Conclusion
Detailed conclusions and findings may be presented in the notebook, providing insights into the predictive performance and the characteristics of fraudulent claims.

#### How to Run
- Ensure that all required libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn) are installed.
- Download the data file used in the notebook.
- Run the notebook in a compatible environment like Jupyter.

Please refer to the notebook for detailed code and explanations.
